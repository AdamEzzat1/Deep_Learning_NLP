The project analyzes the sentimiate towards different airlines based of tweets that were collected from a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)

The goals for this project are as follows:
- What is the general sentiment of the airlines as well as the sentiment of the indiviudual airlines
- Figuring out whether this problem has to be solved with deep learning or if it could be solved with machine learning
- If it can be solved using machine learning which models have the most favorable results
-
